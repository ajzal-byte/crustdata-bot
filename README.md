# Crustdata Chatbot - Level 0

This chatbot is my attempt to get validated as a "cracked dev." Built for the Crustdata Build Challenge, it’s got the basics covered and then some.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: A clean, no-nonsense chat UI where users can ask questions and get answers.
- **Theme Switcher**: Because who doesn't love options? We've got light mode, dark mode, and a fun mode that keeps things interesting.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks good on your phone, tablet, or desktop. We're not picky.

## How It Works

1. **Q&A Matching**: Got a JSON file with some pre-defined questions and answers. The app tries to match user questions with these and spits out the corresponding answer.
2. **Theme Management**: Using React's Context API to handle theme switching. The fun mode randomly picks a color scheme each time you toggle it - just to keep you on your toes!
3. **API Route**: There's a simple API route that handles the Q&A logic. Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this bad boy.
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you're yarn-inclined).
3. Fire it up with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
4. Head to `http://localhost:3000` and start chatting!

## What’s Next?
Taking it to Level 1, where the chatbot gets smarter.
