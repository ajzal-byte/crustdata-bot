    "question": "How do I search for people given their current title, current company, and location?",
    "answer": "You can use the api.crustdata.com/screener/person/search endpoint. Here is an example curl request to find people with title 'engineer' at OpenAI in San Francisco:\n\ncurl --location 'https://api.crustdata.com/screener/person/search' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Token $token' \\\n--data '{\n    \"filters\": [\n        {\"filter_type\": \"CURRENT_COMPANY\", \"type\": \"in\", \"value\": [\"openai.com\"]},\n        {\"filter_type\": \"CURRENT_TITLE\", \"type\": \"in\", \"value\": [\"engineer\"]},\n        {\"filter_type\": \"REGION\", \"type\": \"in\", \"value\": [\"San Francisco, California, United States\"]}\n    ],\n    \"page\": 1\n}'"

  {
    "question": "Is there a standard you're using for the region values?",
    "answer": "Yes, there is a specific list of regions. You can find the list here: https://crustdata-docs-region-json.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/updated_regions.json. Try to match your region values from this list before making an API call."
  },
  {
    "question": "I tried using the screener/person/search API to compare against previous values this weekend. I am blocked on the filter values. It seems like there's a strict set of values for something like a region. Because of that if I pass in something that doesn't fully conform to the list of enums you support for that filter value, the API call fails. The location fields for us are not normalized so I can't make the calls.",
    "answer": "You need to normalize your region values to match the accepted list of enums. Refer to the list of supported regions here: https://crustdata-docs-region-json.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/updated_regions.json."

  {
    "question": "I tried search/enrichment by email but for many entities we have @gmails rather than business emails. Results are not the best.",
    "answer": "The search/enrichment API works best with business emails. Using generic email domains like Gmail may lead to suboptimal results."
